                Key advice: When choosing a kindergarten program, don’t forget to think ahead. Consider both the quality of the kindergarten program itself and whether it helps channel your child into a quality elementary school program that will meet your child’s needs as he or she grows.

                    <p>
        Finishing high school and continuing your education is more important than ever 
        before. According to the Pew Research Center, today’s young adults with only a high 
        school diploma or less “are more likely to be unemployed and [spend] more time 
        searching for a job” (Pew Research Center, February, 2014, <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/" target="_blank">
        “The Rising Cost of Not Going to College”</a>). Deciding to obtain a high school diploma is also an important 
        way to exercise your rights as a resident of New York (rights which are yours 
        regardless of your immigration status). Compulsory school attendance in the US 
        developed over time and for many reasons, but is today linked to the belief that 
        education prepares people as citizens, develops their values, and increases 
        prosperity on both the individual and community level. The law also reflects the 
        contemporary belief that education is a child’s fundamental right.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        It is important to understand all your rights as a student as well as the laws 
        that govern New York’s public educational system. (These rights and responsibilities 
        are described in greater detail in the “Additional Ways to Graduate Directory” 
        available in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/21205E01-0646-409F-970B-1BCBE3A77972/0/AWTG14_15forposting.pdf " target="_blank">English here</a>

        </p>
        <p>
        For example: If you are under 21 and a NYC resident you have:
        
          <li>
            the right to a free public school education or a high school diploma
          </li>
          <li>
            the right to a bilingual education or English as a second language program as 
            provided by law if you are determined to an English Language Learner 
          </li>
          <li>
            students with disabilities who have been determined to be in need of special 
            education are entitled to a free appropriate public education from age 3 until 
            age 21, as provided by law 
          </li>
          <li>
            the right to enroll in high school at any time, until the end of the school 
            year in which you turn 21
            </li>
            <li>
            the right not to be involuntarily transferred to a non-diploma granting or 
            part-time program
            </li>
            <li>
            the right not to be barred from attending classes solely due to age 
            (unless you are over 21 years old), lack of credits, poor grades, truancy, 
            irregular attendance, or failure to pass Regents or RCT examinations
            </li>
            <li>
            the right to request, at any time, an evaluation to determine whether a student needs special education services
            </li>
        
        
        </p>

        
        
        Legal responsibilities:
        
          <li>
          If you are 17 years of age or younger and will turn 17 on or after July 1, you are legally 
          required to remain in school full-time until the end of that school year, 
          unless you have completed a high school or equivalency diploma. 
          </li>
          
          
          </p>

          <p>
          Students are eligible to attend high school until the age of 21 
          (you can go to school until the end of that school year in which you turn 21). 
          However, these students have additional options available to them for obtaining 
          a high school diploma. These options can be explained at a Referral Center for 
          High School Alternatives. Located in each borough, they are open Monday through 
          Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on days that schools are open.
          </p>
          <p>
          
          At Referral Centers, counselors can help you:
        
          <li>
          Find out how to obtain an high school diploma, or enroll in a high school equivalency program
          </li>
          <li>
          Understand your high school transcript
          </li>
          <li>
          Get referrals for childcare, social work, drug treatment and housing;
          </li>
          <li>
          Learn about other programs
          </li>
          <li>
          Take a placement test if necessary

          <p>
          
          Generally speaking, the options they will provide to you are:
        
          <li>
          Stay at or returning to your previous high school –Depending on your age and 
          school history (credit accumulation and Regents examinations) – staying in or 
          returning to your home school may be the best option for you.

          will be among the factors that help determine your options for these programs. 
          Options include:

        You might hear the High School Equivalency test referred to as the “GED.”  
        “GED” is the brand name of the high school equivalency test that was administered 
        prior to 2014. It has been replaced by the TASC exam in New York State. 
        (The change does not affect students who previously took and passed the GED to earn 
        their high school equivalency diploma.
        
        </p>
        <p>

        Free NYC DOE sponsored classes that prepare you for the TASC exam are offered by 
        the Office of Adult and Continuing Education (OACE) during both day and evening, 
        Monday through Saturday at many locations throughout NYC (public schools, libraries, 
        community centers and places of worship). However, students first have to go to an 
        orientation and take an assessment test at one of several Adult Learning Centers 
        (registration locations) located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx 
        (classes themselves are taught at a wider variety of locations).

        The NYC DOE Office of Adult and Continuing Education offers free adult literacy programs, 
        English as a Second Language, and Career and Technical Education classes for free. 
        English as a Second Language and Adult Basic Education students do not need to provide

        classes that lead to certification may be asked to provide a social security number

        <p>
        
        The classes offered by the NYC DOE are not your only option for continuing your education. 
        Other organizations offer similar classes for free or for a fee (some of these resources 
        are described below in the “<a href="en-conted_4.html" target="_blank">
        additional resources 
        </a>” section). Do not assume that a 
        fee-based class is any better than a free class. There have been cases of for-profit 
        schools that have defrauded their students, charging fees for very poor or non-existent 
        services. Other for-profit schools offer high quality instruction with additional materials, 
        supports and a wide variety of class times. You need to be a careful consumer of these services, 
        whether you pay a fee or not.
        
        
        
        </p>
        <p>
        
        When possible, before registering and committing your time (and/or money) to any 
        program, ask to sit in on a class to see what it is like. Consider whether the 
        class requires class participation, group work, extra reading, or homework. 
        Before you enroll you should ask what is expected outside class hours (such as 
        projects or research). Teachers should be certified, experienced, approachable, 
        respectful, and understanding of their students needs. Having this knowledge 
        before you begin can help you successfully complete the program. If you do not 
        like the class, the teacher, center, or any other feature of the program, try another 
        location or a different school/program altogether. You have many options available 
        to you, and not all programs are the same.
