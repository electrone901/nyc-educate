                </h1>
                The Jaime Lucero Mexican Studies Institute at the City University of New York was created in 2012. It has three main purposes: to boost enrollment of Mexican and Mexican-American students in CUNY; to promote the study of Mexico and Mexican communities in the United States; and to support the work of community based organizations that serve the Mexican community in New York City. We are a CUNY-wide institute housed at Lehman College in the Bronx. For more information, visit our website.

                About This Project
                </h1>
                In Spanish, edúcate means, “Educate yourself!” NYCEducate.org is a resource for families living in New York City to obtain information about educational opportunities and resources for everyone: from infants to adults, early child care through adult and post graduate education. This web portal was developed and built by the Jaime Lucero Mexican Studies Institute at Lehman College of the City University of New York, as part of the Anchoring Achievement in Mexican Communities, an initiative supported by Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation. We know how hard it can be to find and use information from multiple, different city and state agencies. We hope this resource helps parents feel empowered in their pursuit of educational opportunities for themselves and their children.
