                Key advice: When choosing a kindergarten program, don’t forget to think ahead. Consider both the quality of the kindergarten program itself and whether it helps channel your child into a quality elementary school program that will meet your child’s needs as he or she grows.

        There are lots of challenges a student faces on the way to a college degree, 
        but often these challenges only intensify for students trying again after having 
        dropped out. Once recent study has found that while 54.1 percent of first-time 
        students completed their degree nationally, only 33.7 percent of non-first-time 
        students achieved the same goal 
        <a href="http://www.insidetrack.com/2014/10/27/national-study-non-first-time-students-shows-disturbing-completion-rates/" target="_blank">
        (See Here).</a> 
        If a student wants to re-enroll after having dropping out, they might find themselves 
        having to re-take classes, or losing credits they accumulated in one institution 
        of they can be transferred to another. It’s often to a student’s advantage—once 
        they start a college program—to stay in it until they’ve graduated.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        It is important to understand all your rights as a student as well as the laws 
        that govern New York’s public educational system. (These rights and responsibilities 
        are described in greater detail in the “Additional Ways to Graduate Directory” 
        available in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/21205E01-0646-409F-970B-1BCBE3A77972/0/AWTG14_15forposting.pdf " target="_blank">English here</a>
        and in

        <p>

        Of course, not everyone chooses the right college the first time around. 
        Sometimes a student’s financial situation, personal life or interests change, 
        and in theses cases switching to a new college or program can be a smart decision. 
        However, all new college students should approach their first year as aware as 
        possible of the challenges they will encounter so they can prepare themselves 
        and find the support and resources necessary to make it to graduation.
        </p>

        There are many diverse, often interrelated factors that lead to poor college outcomes 
        (low grades, graduating late, or not graduating at all). This list shouldn’t 
        deter you—it is meant to help you to anticipate some of these very common 
        roadblocks and plan accordingly:
       
          <li>
            Money: Many students are unaware of the many expenses incurred by a college 
            student. Books (especially course textbooks) and course materials can be 
            extremely costly, and a student might incur new travel expenses or higher 
            food costs. Students might feel pressure to spend money on clothes or 
            entertainment to keep with other kids at school, or they might just find 
            themselves spending more money as a result of having less parental oversight. 
            Jobs offered on campus or through college work-study programs might not be 
            enough to cover these expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work: related to the above point, many students work long hours to support 
            themselves or their families. They might find themselves unable to finish 
            their assignments on time or participate in group projects. They might find 
            themselves exhausted from the combined demands of school and work. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of family support: many students come from families who don’t support 
            their pursuit of a college degree. Families might see college as an unnecessary 
            expense or even as a waste of time, especially if a student could be earning 
            what seems like “good money” entering the labor market now. Families that 
            support the idea of going to college might not be able to offer financial, 
            logistical, or emotional support, or they might not know how to reassure 
            students when they are facing challenges. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Loneliness: Many first-time college students experience feeling “like a 
            fish out of water,” overwhelmed by cultural differences or by other students 
            who seem to “know what they are doing.” Students often miss they family, 
            friends and teachers they left behind in their former schools/lives (this is 
            even especially acute in the case of students who move away from home).
            </li>
            <li>
            Academics: Students might themselves underprepared academically or just unsure 
            of their teachers’ expectations. A few bad grades might lead them to believe 
            they weren’t “cut out” for college.
            </li>
            <li>
            New responsibilities: Sometimes, going to college also coincides with having 
            new responsibilities--taking on new chores or tasks that other adults 
            (a parent, grandparent, teacher) previously performed for you. You might have 
            to cook, clean, or do laundry for yourself. You have to organize your own 
            schedule, choose your own classes, and manage your own course load. Students 
            are expected to be self-starters and punctual. They need to manage distractions 
            without anyone necessarily looking over their shoulder. Also, they need to 
            problem solve in new ways and find the answers questions such as:  how does 
            my GPA affect my financial aid, will tuition rates change next year, what 
            are the requirements for graduation, and how will my choices now affect my 
            career prospects after graduation?

        There are many things you can do before you start college and during the first 
        year to help you get through and reach your goal of graduation:
        
          <li>
            Make a financial plan: consider budgeting both your major financial expenses 
            and your day-to-day expenses. Try to have a ‘cushion’ of extra money for 
            unanticipated expenses and problems. Talk to students who have already 
            finished their first year about their budgets and expenses. Go to the 
            financial aid office and talk with a counselor there to understand what you 
            are paying now, what you are expected to pay back in the future if you have loans, 
            and how tuition costs might change in the future. Also, find out if your college 
            career center has resources on grants, scholarships and awards you can earn during 
            your college career (e.g., the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund 
            <a href="https://hsf.net/" target="_blank">
        See Here
        </a> ).
          </li>
          <li>
            Meet your professors during offices hours whenever possible, even if just to 
            introduce yourself. If you anticipate having any problems (e.g., problems 
            meeting a deadline, finding the right resources, turning in assignments) 
            talk to your professors <strong>well ahead</strong> of any deadlines to ask for assistance or 
            advice. Ask if their department has resources available to help you improve 
            (workshops, study sessions, or tutors). Take advantage of meetings with any 
            assigned counselors, advisors, or student mentors to talk about your fears, 
            challenges, and to get their suggestions and feedback. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember that no one successfully graduates from college on their own. 
            Successful students almost invariably have parents, siblings, a mentor or 
            close friend who has “been there before” (attended college before). Make one 
            of your first year priorities to create a support network for yourself: go to 
            your professors’ office hours (or make an appointment with professors if you 
            can’t make their designated office hours, which are often during the day); talk 
            to staff such as librarians and career counselors; visit health or mental health 
            services if you need to. Try to find ways to connect with fellow students and 
            make friends: go to groups, participate in activities, join (helpful, positive) 
            social media groups. Ask people for advice, try opening up, and allow others 
            to help you.
