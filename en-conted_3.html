        The NYC DOE Office of Adult and Continuing Education offers free adult literacy programs, 
        English as a Second Language, and Career and Technical Education classes for free. 
        English as a Second Language and Adult Basic Education students do not need to provide 
        their social security number. Students who register in Career and Technical Education 
        classes that lead to certification may be asked to provide a social security number 
        or other documents to verify their identity for job placement.
        </br>
        </br>
        
        The classes offered by the NYC DOE are not your only option for continuing your education. 
        Other organizations offer similar classes for free or for a fee (some of these resources 
        are described below in the “<a href="en-conted_4.html" target="_blank">
        additional resources 
        </a>” section). Do not assume that a 
        fee-based class is any better than a free class. There have been cases of for-profit 
        schools that have defrauded their students, charging fees for very poor or non-existent 
        services. Other for-profit schools offer high quality instruction with additional materials, 
        supports and a wide variety of class times. You need to be a careful consumer of these services, 
        whether you pay a fee or not.
        
        
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
        When possible, before registering and committing your time (and/or money) to any 
        program, ask to sit in on a class to see what it is like. Consider whether the 
        class requires class participation, group work, extra reading, or homework. 
        Before you enroll you should ask what is expected outside class hours (such as 
        projects or research). Teachers should be certified, experienced, approachable, 
        respectful, and understanding of their students needs. Having this knowledge 
        before you begin can help you successfully complete the program. If you do not 
        like the class, the teacher, center, or any other feature of the program, try another 
        location or a different school/program altogether. You have many options available 
        to you, and not all programs are the same.
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
        To attend a class given by the Office of Adult and Continuing Education, students 
        first have to go to an orientation and take an assessment test at one of several 
        Adult Learning Centers (registration locations) located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, 
        Queens and the Bronx (classes themselves are taught at a wider variety of locations). 
        Registration locations and numbers are listed at: 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/AdultEd/classes/RegistrationLocations.htm" target="_blank">
        here. 
        </a>
        These locations also offer other services such as case management, student orientation, 
        and goal setting workshops. Locations should be contacted ahead of time to find out 
        when an orientation is being held. If you have trouble reaching your desired Adult 
        Learning Center or encounter other problems, you can call the OACE central office at 
        718-638-2635 (prompts are in English) or 311.
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
        Some OACE programs (in addition the to high school equivalency preparation 
        classes described above) include:
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
        <u>Adult Basic Education (ABE) Instruction</u> - skills related to adult literacy needs, 
        educational goals, and personal interests. Adults enrolled in ABE classes can 
        advance to high school equivalency preparation and vocational training.
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
        <u>English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Instruction</u> - 
        basic language skills, as well as the academic and civic skills they need to 
        successfully complete higher education or job training programs.  
        
        </br>
        </br>
        <u>Career and Technical Training</u> – courses to acquire technical, trade, construction, 
        or entrepreneurial skills (a high school diploma may be required for some of these classes). 
        Classes cover many topics in many general areas such as:
        <ul>
        <li>
        Health Trades – Training to become a Licensed Practical Nursing, Certified Nurse 
        Assistant, Phlebotomist, and in Medial Billing and Coding,
