        <b>Early Head Start and Head Start</b>
        <br>
        <i> Age Availability </i>
        <br>
        Early Head Start is for pregnant women, infants, and toddlers. Head Start is for children ages 3-5.
        <br>
        <i> What is it?</i>
        <br>
          Early Head Start and Head Start are federally funded community-based programs for low-income families with infants and/or toddlers, and for pregnant women. New York’s Head Start and Early Head Start programs focus on the well being of the child through educational, health, nutritional, and social services. Parents and family members play an important role in the programs. They are encouraged to be the first and most important educators of their children. Children in the programs are exposed to a multi-cultural environment that provides pre-literacy and literacy experiences and promotes school readiness. Children with disabilities are also welcome at Head Start, and additional programs are often available for parents and other family members. 
        <br>
          Head Start is free for eligible low-income families regardless of documentation/immigration status. In order to enroll in Head Start families must meet certain income requirements. Parents can call to find a local center, see if there is space available, and discuss the paperwork they may need to provide. Usually, they will need:
        <br>
        Proof of income (if they get paid cash a notarized letter can be used to prove income)
        <br>
        Child's Birth Certificate
        <br>
        Child's immunization Card
        <br>
        Proof of Residence
        <br>
        Proof of Health Insurance
        <br>
        If these documents are not available, parents should ask what alternatives they can provide to otherwise meet requirements. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>For more detailed information on the services provided by Head Start and to find a center call 212-232-0966 or visit the webpage (in English and Spanish):</b>

        <b>Early Head Start and Head Start</b>
        <br>
        <i> Age Availability </i>
        <br>
        Birth to five years
        <br>
        <i>What is it?</i>
        <br>
        Certain Head Start and child care providers are part of the EarlyLearn NYC program, which according to the Administration for Child Services "is an innovative, high-quality early education program" both for low and moderate income families. Parents have the option of choosing the type of care their child will receive. Experienced teachers and caregivers who offer social, emotional, and educational instruction will care for children in this program. Free daily nutritious meals are available to the children in this program. 
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Parent Child Home Program (PCHP)</b>
        <br>
        <i> Ages</i>
        <br>
        16 months to 4 years
        <br>
        <i>What is it?</i>
        <br>
        PCHP programs provide home-based services to low-income and especially immigrant families, who live in isolation, have limited educational opportunities, experience language and literacy barriers that prevent healthy child development and educational success. The two-year long program consists of 30-minute weekly home visitations, two days a week.  Each week PCHP sends an early literacy specialist to the home who is bilingual and bicultural (in families’ native languages and cultures). At each visit families are provided with a high-quality book or educational toy that is a gift to the family. Using the book or toy, the literacy specialist models reading, conversation, and play activities designed to stimulate parent-child interaction, develop language and literacy skills, and build school readiness. PCHP early literacy specialists are also able to connect families to other community resources including food, housing, medical, and educational services.  Upon completion of the program, all families are assisted in enrolling their children in a high-quality, center-based preschool program.
        <br>
        <br>
        PCHP is offered by various organizations. Find a center near you go to:

        <b>Child Care (not the same as Head Start!)</b>
        <br>
        <i>Child Care</i>
        <br>
        Quality child care allows children to play in a stimulating and nurturing environment. To keep children safe and healthy while they are in a provider’s care, the government licenses and regulates child care facilities and inspects them regularly.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order for a family to receive help paying for child care services, the family must meet specific financial and social eligibility criteria that are determined by federal, state, and local regulations. To find out if your family is eligible you need to talk with someone from the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS). Call 311 or visit 311 online’s Child Care Financial Assistance finder:
