        Finishing high school and continuing your education is more important than ever 
        before. According to the Pew Research Center, today’s young adults with only a high 
        school diploma or less “are more likely to be unemployed and [spend] more time 
        searching for a job” (Pew Research Center, February, 2014, <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/" target="_blank">
        “The Rising Cost of Not Going to College”</a>). Deciding to obtain a high school diploma is also an important 
        way to exercise your rights as a resident of New York (rights which are yours 
        regardless of your immigration status). Compulsory school attendance in the US 
        developed over time and for many reasons, but is today linked to the belief that 
        education prepares people as citizens, develops their values, and increases 
        prosperity on both the individual and community level. The law also reflects the 
        contemporary belief that education is a child’s fundamental right.
        </br>
        </br>
        
        It is important to understand all your rights as a student as well as the laws 
        that govern New York’s public educational system. (These rights and responsibilities 
        are described in greater detail in the “Additional Ways to Graduate Directory” 
        available in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/21205E01-0646-409F-970B-1BCBE3A77972/0/AWTG14_15forposting.pdf " target="_blank">English here</a>
        and in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/92962BE3-6826-4E06-BC90-FCFD5D4C5E7C/0/1_Introduction2013_14_Spanish.pdf" target="_blank">Spanish here</a>).  
        </br>
        </br>
        For example: If you are under 21 and a NYC resident you have:
        <ul>
          <li>
            the right to a free public school education or a high school diploma
          </li>
          <li>
            the right to a bilingual education or English as a second language program as 
            provided by law if you are determined to an English Language Learner 
          </li>
          <li>
            students with disabilities who have been determined to be in need of special 
            education are entitled to a free appropriate public education from age 3 until 
            age 21, as provided by law 
          </li>
          <li>
            the right to enroll in high school at any time, until the end of the school 
            year in which you turn 21
            </li>
            <li>
            the right not to be involuntarily transferred to a non-diploma granting or 
            part-time program
            </li>
            <li>
            the right not to be barred from attending classes solely due to age 
            (unless you are over 21 years old), lack of credits, poor grades, truancy, 
            irregular attendance, or failure to pass Regents or RCT examinations
            </li>
            <li>
            the right to request, at any time, an evaluation to determine whether a student needs special education services
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        </br>

        
        
        Legal responsibilities:
        <ul>
          <li>
          If you are 17 years of age or younger and will turn 17 on or after July 1, you are legally 
          required to remain in school full-time until the end of that school year, 
          unless you have completed a high school or equivalency diploma. 
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          </br>

          
          Students are eligible to attend high school until the age of 21 
          (you can go to school until the end of that school year in which you turn 21). 
          However, these students have additional options available to them for obtaining 
          a high school diploma. These options can be explained at a Referral Center for 
          High School Alternatives. Located in each borough, they are open Monday through 
          Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on days that schools are open.
          </br>
          </br>
          
          At Referral Centers, counselors can help you:
        <ul>
          <li>
          Find out how to obtain an high school diploma, or enroll in a high school equivalency program
          </li>
          <li>
          Understand your high school transcript
          </li>
          <li>
          Get referrals for childcare, social work, drug treatment and housing;
          </li>
          <li>
          Learn about other programs
          </li>
          <li>
          Take a placement test if necessary
          </li>
          </ul>
          
          </br>
          
          The website for NYC DOE Referral Centers is located at
          <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/SpecialPrograms/AlternativesHS/Referral/default.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
          The page can be translated into Spanish or many other languages by clicking on 
          the language option in the upper right hand corner of the webpage.
          </br>
          </br>
          
          Generally speaking, the options they will provide to you are:
        <ul>
          <li>
          Stay at or returning to your previous high school –Depending on your age and 
          school history (credit accumulation and Regents examinations) – staying in or 
          returning to your home school may be the best option for you. 
          </li>
          <li>
          Enrolling in a new high school: for more on enrolling as a new student, 
          see the section 
          <a href="nine-twelve.html" target="_blank">
          “How to enroll in public school (for students new to NYC, grades 9-12) 
          or find a high school alternative (for students 15-21)”
          </a>
          </li>
          <li>
          Enroll in another school or program that can help you graduate 
          (see the section the follows): your age and personal considerations 
          (such as whether you can take classes during the day or evenings only) 
          will be among the factors that help determine your options for these programs. 
          Options include:
          </li>
          <ul>
          <li>
