       and the “Zero to Three” website created by the National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families, especially the document "BrainWonders & Sharing Books with Babies." 2003. Available at

      <b>The benefits of reading to your baby/toddler/child</b>
       <ul>
        <li>
          Babies who are read to are more likely to grow up with a love of reading.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading has been shown to significantly stimulate brain development. Infants, for example, learn to listen to and comprehend language while being read to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Babies learn literacy fundamentals such as: associating pictures with words, turning pages in a book, holding a book the "right" way, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Babies begin to learn the significance of various tones of voice when parents read with expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading exposes all children to new vocabulary and concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          By reading you give your child the opportunity to learn how words come together in interesting sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading to your child builds their attention span, listening skills, and memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Children are exposed to literacy concepts such as rhyme, rhythm, and repetition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Children's knowledge of the world around them is increased when parents and teachers choose books that include relevant text and engaging illustrations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading is a bonding experience for the child and parent, a joyful interaction that brings books to life for children. It is not only for babies: being read to by parents or caregivers is a powerful experience for children throughout the elementary school years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Children develop a positive relationship with books and see that their parents value books and learning as well.
        </li>
       </ul>
        <b>
        Ways to Share Books with Infants and Toddlers
        </b>
        Remember you do not need many books to share with your child, although it is recommended that households have at least 10 books on a variety of subjects. Your local library is a great place to get books. The most important part of sharing books with your child is the time and interaction you dedicate to him or her. Find you local NYC public library branch here: 
        <a href="http://www.nypl.org/locations/" target="_blank">NYPL.ORG</a> (in English).
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Ways to Share Books with Older Children</b>
        Even older children like to be read to. Many value it as important time spent one-on-one with their parents. However, children as young as three years old can memorize a story, and many children love to show their creativity and skills by reading to their parents!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Make Sharing Books Part of Every Day</b>
        Read or share stories at bedtime or on the bus or subway.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Have Fun</b>
        Children can learn from you that books are fun, which is an important ingredient in learning to read.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A Few Minutes is OK—Don't Worry if You Don't Finish the Story</b>
        Young children can only sit for a few minutes for a story, but as they grow, they will be able to sit longer.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Talk or Sing about the Pictures</b>
        You do not have to read the words to tell a story.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Let Children Turn the Pages</b>
        Babies need help turning pages, but a three-year-old can do it alone. Remember, it's OK to skip pages!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Show Children the Cover</b>
        Explain what the story is about, or imagine what it is about before you read it (“Do you think this story will be about animals? People? Let’s find out!”).
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Show Children the Words</b>
        Run your finger along the words as you read them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Make the Story Come Alive</b>
        Create voices for the story characters and use your body to tell the story.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Make It Personal</b>
        Talk about your own family, pets, or community when you are reading about others in a story.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Ask Questions about the Story, and Let Children Ask Questions, too! </b>
        Use the story to engage in conversation and to talk about familiar activities and objects.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Make Connections</b>
        If you read a book about dogs and on your walk to the park you see a dog, point out the dog so your child will begin to make the connection between what you are reading and real life.
