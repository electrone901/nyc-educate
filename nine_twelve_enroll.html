        How to enroll in public school (for students new to NYC, grades 9-12) or find a high school alternative (for students 15-21)
      </div>
      <div class="section-copy">
        Students in grades 9 through 12 should be enrolled in school right away. To find a high school that can accept your child, you can visit a 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/NewStudents/WelcomeCenters/default.htm">Family Welcome Center</a> in person, call 311 or the Department of Education at 718-935-3500, or use the ‘School Search’ tool at the Department of Education website:
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolsearch/" target="_blank">NYC.GOV School Search</a>
        When speaking to someone either on the phone or in person, you can always ask for a translator if this would make the conversation easier. Going to a Welcome Center first is also a good idea if your child has received <a href="glossary.html#specEd">special educational</a> services previously and/or has an <a href="glossary.html#iep">IEP</a> from outside of New York City.
        </br>
        </br>
        At your assigned school, you need the required documentation to be enrolled:
        <ul>
        <li>
          Child’s birth certificate or passport as proof of age
        </li>
        <li>
          Immunization records 
        </li>
        <li>
          Latest report card/transcript (if available)
        </li>
        <li>
          Individualized Education Program (IEP) and/or 504 Accommodation Plan (if applicable and available)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Required Proof of NYC Residence (any two of the following):</b>
          Utility bill (gas or electric) for the residence issued by National Grid (formerly Keyspan), Con Edison, or the Long Island Power Authority (for the Rockaways); must be dated within the past 60 days
          <br>
          Water bill for the residence; must be dated within the past 90 days
          <br>
          Original lease agreement, deed, or mortgage statement for the residence
          <br>
          Current property tax bill for the residence 
          <br>
          Official payroll document from an employer (example: payroll receipt); must be dated within the past 60 days 
          <br>
          Document or letter from a federal, state, or local government agency indicating the resident’s name and address (example: document from Internal Revenue Service (IRS), City Housing Authority, the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS)); must be dated within the past 60 days
        </li>
        </ul>
        </br>
          If you do not have the required documentation, you should still go to enroll your child. They will be admitted to school provisionally while a solution is worked out (for example, if you are neither the leaseholder nor owner of your residence, you will be asked to submit a Residency Affidavit).
        </br>
        </br>
          Not all high schools have services designed for recently arrived 
          <a href="glossary.html#ell">English Language Learners (ELLs)</a> 
          at the high school level. If a student is a new arrival to the US, they should consider enrolling in one of New York City’s specialized “International Schools.” These are high schools specifically designed to serve students who are new to the US and meet certain language criteria. These schools not only offer instruction in academic subjects (including acquiring fluency in English), but they also support new arrivals as they learn to handle new social and cultural situations. Like other schools they offer extra-curricular activities and prepare students for opportunities after high school, including college. You can get a list of these schools at a <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/NewStudents/WelcomeCenters/default.html" target="_blank">Family Welcome Center</a>. Contact the schools directly for admissions information.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="remember">
        <b>
          Remember that by law, students may not be required or asked to present documentation of immigration status nor can they be denied admission to school based on immigration status or failure to present documentation about immigration status. Also, references to the immigration status of a child or parent cannot appear on any school forms or records.

        </div>
        </br>
        <a href="http://www.nyccharterschools.org/" target="_blank">Charter schools</a> have their own admissions processes. You need to contact these schools directly for more information about how to apply. For more information on charter schools,

        If a young adult is not enrolled in school but is 21 years old or younger, lives in NYC and needs help reentering high school, they can also go to a Referral Center for High School Alternatives (part of 
        <a href="glossary.html#d79">“District 79”</a> which consists of alternative schools and programs). There is a Referral Center in each borough with guidance counselors.  
        </br>
        </br>
        They will help students figure out how to earn a high school diploma or its equivalent. To find more information on Referral Centers, call the District 79 Office of Student Support Services at 917-521-3639 or go to the Department of Education website at:
