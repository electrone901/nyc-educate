        Students 21 and over can still access free city educational programs to obtain 
        their high school equivalency diplomas—regardless of their immigration status. 
        This section will focus on Adult and Continuing Education programs run by the NYC 
        Department of Education. However, many libraries, community centers, faith-based 
        organizations, community colleges, and other local service providers throughout 
        NYC offer free classes that prepare students for the high school equivalency test, 
        also called the TASC (Test Assessing Secondary Completion). Some of these other 
        test prep service providers will be listed in the 
        <a href="en-conted_4.html" target="_blank">

        </br>
        
        You might hear the High School Equivalency test referred to as the “GED.”  
        “GED” is the brand name of the high school equivalency test that was administered 
        prior to 2014. It has been replaced by the TASC exam in New York State. 
        (The change does not affect students who previously took and passed the GED to earn 
        their high school equivalency diploma.
        
        </br>
        </br>
        Free NYC DOE sponsored classes that prepare you for the TASC exam are offered by 
        the Office of Adult and Continuing Education (OACE) during both day and evening, 
        Monday through Saturday at many locations throughout NYC (public schools, libraries, 
        community centers and places of worship). However, students first have to go to an 
        orientation and take an assessment test at one of several Adult Learning Centers 
        (registration locations) located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx 
        (classes themselves are taught at a wider variety of locations). 
        Registration locations and numbers are listed 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/AdultEd/classes/RegistrationLocations.htm" target="_blank">
        here 
        </a>. 
        These locations also offer other services such as case management, student orientation, 
        and goal setting workshops. Locations should be contacted ahead of time to find out 
        when an orientation is being held. If you have trouble reaching your desired Adult 
        Learning Center or encounter other problems, you can call the OACE central office 
        at 718-638-2635 (prompts are in English) or 311.

        Test of Basic Adult Education (TBAE) is required of all first time applicants. 
        It is a math and reading test to assess academic readiness and appropriate course 
        placement. If an applicants results fall below the requirements, they will be 
        offered literacy classes to help them reach the level of readiness required for 
        their original course of choice.
