        There are lots of challenges a student faces on the way to a college degree, 
        but often these challenges only intensify for students trying again after having 
        dropped out. Once recent study has found that while 54.1 percent of first-time 
        students completed their degree nationally, only 33.7 percent of non-first-time 
        students achieved the same goal 
        <a href="http://www.insidetrack.com/2014/10/27/national-study-non-first-time-students-shows-disturbing-completion-rates/" target="_blank">
        (See Here).</a> 
        If a student wants to re-enroll after having dropping out, they might find themselves 
        having to re-take classes, or losing credits they accumulated in one institution 
        of they can be transferred to another. It’s often to a student’s advantage—once 
        they start a college program—to stay in it until they’ve graduated.
        </br>
        </br>
        
        It is important to understand all your rights as a student as well as the laws 
        that govern New York’s public educational system. (These rights and responsibilities 
        are described in greater detail in the “Additional Ways to Graduate Directory” 
        available in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/21205E01-0646-409F-970B-1BCBE3A77972/0/AWTG14_15forposting.pdf " target="_blank">English here</a>
        and in 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/92962BE3-6826-4E06-BC90-FCFD5D4C5E7C/0/1_Introduction2013_14_Spanish.pdf" target="_blank">Spanish here</a>).  
        </br>
        </br>
        Of course, not everyone chooses the right college the first time around. 
        Sometimes a student’s financial situation, personal life or interests change, 
        and in theses cases switching to a new college or program can be a smart decision. 
        However, all new college students should approach their first year as aware as 
        possible of the challenges they will encounter so they can prepare themselves 
        and find the support and resources necessary to make it to graduation.
        </br>
        </br>
        
        There are many diverse, often interrelated factors that lead to poor college outcomes 
        (low grades, graduating late, or not graduating at all). This list shouldn’t 
        deter you—it is meant to help you to anticipate some of these very common 
        roadblocks and plan accordingly:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Money: Many students are unaware of the many expenses incurred by a college 
            student. Books (especially course textbooks) and course materials can be 
            extremely costly, and a student might incur new travel expenses or higher 
            food costs. Students might feel pressure to spend money on clothes or 
            entertainment to keep with other kids at school, or they might just find 
            themselves spending more money as a result of having less parental oversight. 
            Jobs offered on campus or through college work-study programs might not be 
            enough to cover these expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work: related to the above point, many students work long hours to support 
            themselves or their families. They might find themselves unable to finish 
            their assignments on time or participate in group projects. They might find 
            themselves exhausted from the combined demands of school and work. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of family support: many students come from families who don’t support 
            their pursuit of a college degree. Families might see college as an unnecessary 
            expense or even as a waste of time, especially if a student could be earning 
            what seems like “good money” entering the labor market now. Families that 
            support the idea of going to college might not be able to offer financial, 
            logistical, or emotional support, or they might not know how to reassure 
            students when they are facing challenges. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Loneliness: Many first-time college students experience feeling “like a 
            fish out of water,” overwhelmed by cultural differences or by other students 
            who seem to “know what they are doing.” Students often miss they family, 
            friends and teachers they left behind in their former schools/lives (this is 
            even especially acute in the case of students who move away from home).
            </li>
            <li>
            Academics: Students might themselves underprepared academically or just unsure 
            of their teachers’ expectations. A few bad grades might lead them to believe 
            they weren’t “cut out” for college.
            </li>
            <li>
            New responsibilities: Sometimes, going to college also coincides with having 
            new responsibilities--taking on new chores or tasks that other adults 
            (a parent, grandparent, teacher) previously performed for you. You might have 
            to cook, clean, or do laundry for yourself. You have to organize your own 
            schedule, choose your own classes, and manage your own course load. Students 
            are expected to be self-starters and punctual. They need to manage distractions 
            without anyone necessarily looking over their shoulder. Also, they need to 
            problem solve in new ways and find the answers questions such as:  how does 
            my GPA affect my financial aid, will tuition rates change next year, what 
            are the requirements for graduation, and how will my choices now affect my 
            career prospects after graduation?
            </li>
