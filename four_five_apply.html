        How to apply to middle school (for 5th grade students)
      </div>
      <div class="section-copy">
        During the 5th grade, all NYC public school children participate in the general middle school application process. Students attending elementary schools that go beyond 5th grade can apply to stay at their current school, where they are usually given priority over new students. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="glossary.html#charter">Charter schools</a> and a few middle schools listed in your child’s directory have their own admissions processes and do not participate in the general middle school admissions process described here. You need to contact these schools directly for more information about how to apply. For more information on charter school admissions, 
        <a href="http://www.nyccharterschools.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Students not currently enrolled in a New York City public school (parochial and private school students) will need to request an application for the district in which they live from their local Family Welcome Center. They will also need to provide a 2014 report card from the child’s school with grades, attendance, and teacher comments so that they can be included as part of the admissions process. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Students with disabilities may apply to all schools and/or programs available to the general student population in their district. They will be subject to the same admissions requirements as their general education peers, although testing accommodations will be provided if the student’s 
        <a href="glossary.html#iep">IEP</a>
        requires these. Students whose IEPs recommend a specialized 
        <a href="glossary.html#d75">District 75</a>
        program and who wish to continue in a District 75 program are not required to participate in the middle school admissions process: these students will be notified of their District 75 placement in May or June. For students considering a move from their District 75 program to a community school, the Department of Education recommends that they participate in the middle school admissions process. For more information, visit: 
        <a href="http://nyc.gov/schools/Academics/SpecialEducation" target="_blank">NYC.GOV Special Education</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The general middle school admissions process formally begins the in fall. Students and their parents should meet with their child’s guidance counselor or someone at the school who can help them understand the options available to their child. The options are the schools and programs your child is eligible to attend: your child will only be able to apply to schools/programs for which they meet the eligibility criteria. These options will include middle schools based in your child’s zoned district, “Boroughwide” middle schools open to all students and residents of the borough, and “Citywide” middle schools open to all students and residents of New York City. They should also receive (or ask for) a copy of the Middle School Directory for their district. It is also available on line along with other Department of Education resources at 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/Middle/Resources/default.htm" target="_blank">NYC.GOV Resources</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        During September and October parents and students should attend district “Middle School Fairs” at which they can meet representatives from different schools. How should you identify a good fit for your child? There are many factors you and your student can consider: location, specialized programming or curriculum, educational approach or philosophy, class size, culture or atmosphere, test scores, student-teacher ratio, discipline or homework policies, facilities, performance record and diversity are only a few. Every child has unique needs and their considerations will be similarly unique.<i> This is also time to submit to your guidance counselor a “request for testing” or “RFT” for schools that require students to take a test for admissions.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Families should directly contact any schools the student is interested in to be sure they understand the schools’ admission priorities (the order by which applicants are considered for placement) and admissions methods (the ways in which applicants are admitted). Ideally they should attend the schools’ open houses (when the school is open to the public for visits and to answer questions) or sign up for tours. Visiting the school allows you to meet teachers and students, see the facilities (see the library, lunchroom and classrooms), question the principal, and gauge the overall atmosphere. Also, safety starts to become especially important for middle school, and parents should not be afraid to ask about the climate of the school, how bullying is handled, whether children are safe traveling to and from school on their own, etc. Schools should always accommodate parents' needs for translation of the information provided. It is appropriate to ask if there will be an interpreter or bilingual speakers/guides at an open house or tour. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>It’s important to note that some schools have selection criteria which give priority to students who attend an open house, tour, or Middle School Fair (in which case it is important to sign in at these events), and some schools’ admissions methods require writing samples, teacher recommendations, interviews or auditions.</b>  In addition to the admissions criteria, other factors can affect the likelihood of your child being accepted. The number of seats available may be smaller than the number of applications the school receives. How you rank these schools on the form can also affect their chances of being accepted. Each school’s admissions priorities, admissions methods, specific selection criteria, number of seats available, demand history, performance indicators, and other important statistics are listed in the Middle School Directory. Given the amount of data and variety of different procedures, you should start your own selection process as early in the school year as possible. If some aspect of the process is unduly burdensome or prohibitive to your family (for example, you cannot attend an open house because of work, distance, disability, or you are worried about language barriers), you should contact the school immediately and explore your options (work with your school guidance counselor to help you do this).
        <br>
        <br>
        In November, students receive a middle school application that is pre-populated (pre-filled in) with all of the schools for which they are eligible. If your student’s form seems to be missing options you expected to see, it is important to meet with the guidance counselor as soon as possible to understand any omissions or to have the form corrected. You will rank your choices on the application form. If a middle school has more than one program (for example, an honors program), these will be listed separately on the application.
        <br>
        <br>
        In December students submit completed applications to guidance counselors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Early in the next year (January-March), where required, students will attend scheduled auditions or interviews and hand in outstanding materials necessary to complete their applications. Around March, a second application round is available for students who also wish to apply to newly opened middle schools. In May, approximately, middle school match results are distributed from both rounds. Students who are unhappy with their match may file an appeal by notifying their school by letter.
