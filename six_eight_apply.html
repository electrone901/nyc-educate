        How to apply to high school (for all 8th grade and first time 9th grade students)

      <div class="section-copy">
        During the 8th grade, all NYC public school children participate in the general high school application process. Students attending schools that go beyond 8th grade can apply to stay at their current school, where they are usually given priority over new students. 
        <br>

        and 
        <a href="glossary.html#specialized">specialized high schools</a> 
        listed in the High School Directory have their own admissions processes and do not participate in the general high school admissions process described here. You need to contact these schools directly for more information about how to apply. For more information on charter schools and specialized high schools, see below.
      <br>
      <br>
        8th grade students not currently enrolled in a New York City public school (parochial and private school students) should receive information on public NYC high schools from their guidance counselors—ask if you do not. 
      <br>
      <br>
        Students with disabilities may apply to all schools and/or programs available to the general student population in their district. They will be subject to the same admissions requirements as their general education peers, although testing accommodations will be provided if the student’s 
        <a href="glossary.html#iep">IEP</a>
        requires these. Students whose IEPs recommend a specialized 
        <a href="glossary.html#d75">District 75</a>
        program and who wish to continue in a District 75 program are not required to participate in the middle school admissions process: these students will be notified of their District 75 placement in May or June. For students considering a move from their District 75 program to a community school, the Department of Education recommends that they participate in the middle school admissions process. For more information, visit: 
        <a href="http://nyc.gov/schools/Academics/SpecialEducation" target="_blank">NYC.GOV Special Education</a>
      <br>
      <br>
        High School Directories are generally available to students during their 7th grade year. Many students and their families use the summer before 8th grade to start researching their options, attending summer workshops to learn about the admissions process, and, if their child is interested in a specialized high school, to study for the specialized high school test. 
      <br>
      <br>
        High School Directories are also available at the 
        <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/High/Resources/default.html" target="_blank">DOE website</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      The general high school admissions process formally begins the in fall of 8th grade. Students and their parents should meet with their child’s guidance counselor to help them understand the options available to their child. The options are the high school programs your child is eligible to attend: your child will only be able to apply to programs for which they meet the eligibility criteria. 
      <br>
      <br>
      There are different types of high school programs located throughout NYC. Some schools put added emphasis on career training or skills, and some offer industry certification as well as diplomas. International schools specialize in serving students who are new to the US and meet certain language criteria. These schools not only offer instruction in academic subjects (including acquiring fluency in English), but they also support new arrivals as they learn to navigate new social and cultural situations. Like other schools they offer extra-curricular activities and prepare students for opportunities after high school. Consortium schools have their students complete performance assessments consisting of research, presentations, and defenses instead of taking Regents exams. Other schools offer more traditional approaches and courses of study. It is helpful to start early to understand all the options available and, importantly, how they match with a student’s learning style, aspirations, and other individual characteristics. 
      <br>
      <br>
      During September and October parents and students should attend district “High School Fairs” at which they can meet representatives from different schools. How should you identify a good fit for your child? There are many factors you and your student can consider: location, specialized programming or curriculum, educational approach or philosophy, class size, culture or atmosphere, test scores, student-teacher ratio, disciplinary or homework policies, facilities, performance record, extracurricular activities, AP/honors options, graduation rates, and diversity are only a few.  Don’t forget that the High Schools Directory offers information that complements what you can learn during visits and interviews. For example, some schools have a good record of graduating students on time and their students go on to college, while other schools have a low graduation rate or college acceptance rate. These percentages are listed in the Directory. Other factors, such as school safety and its ‘feel’ for an individual child, cannot be understood or identified by reading the Directory alone. The Directory, visits, tours, open houses, and conversations with current and former students and staff are all an important part of your selection process.
      <br>
      <br>
      Students and their families should directly contact any schools they are interested in to determine the schools’ admission priorities (the order by which applicants are considered for placement) and admissions methods (the ways in which applicants are admitted). Ideally they should attend the schools’ open houses (when the school is open to the public for visits and to answer questions) or sign up for tours. Visiting the school allows you to meet teachers and students, see the facilities (see the library, lunchroom and classrooms), question the principal, and gauge the overall atmosphere.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>It’s important to note that some schools have selection criteria which give priority to students who attend an open house, tour, or High School Fair (in which case it is important to sign in at these events), and some schools’ admissions methods require writing samples, teacher recommendations, interviews or auditions.</b>  In addition to the admissions criteria, other factors can affect the likelihood of your child being accepted. The number of seats available may be smaller than the number of applications the school receives. How you rank these schools on the form can also impact the odds chances of being accepted. Each school’s admissions priorities, admissions methods, specific selection criteria, number of seats available, demand history, performance indicators, and other important statistics are listed in the High School Directory. If some aspect of the process is unduly burdensome or prohibitive to your family (for example, you cannot attend an open house because of work, distance, disability, or you are worried about language barriers), you should contact the school immediately and explore your options (work with your school guidance counselor to help you do this). 
      <br>
      <br>
      In December students submit completed applications to guidance counselors. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Early in the next year (January-March), where required, students will attend scheduled auditions or interviews and hand in materials necessary to complete their applications. Around March, Round 1 results are available, and a second round (Round 2) is conducted for students who either failed to be matched to a program or who were unhappy with their match. In May, Round 2 results are announced and appeals can be made. If a student is placed in a school, it can be very difficult to obtain a placement in a different school. For that reason, it is important to be as careful and thoughtful about the first round selection process as possible.

        To apply to a High School program at a 
        <a href="glossary.html#charter">charter school</a>: 
        These schools operate separately from the Department of Education and develop their own academic programs of learning, but they must meet performance goals to remain open. They have a separate admissions process and priorities (e.g., priority for children in a charter school’s community school district). Some charter schools are highly sought after, feature innovative programming, and have high testing and graduation rates. Critics say that charter schools are sometimes of variable quality or use policies that manipulate measures of success. 
      <br>

      The primary web source for charter school information is

      <br>
      <br>
      To apply to a charter school, you need to contact that school directly for information and for a paper application. You may be able to submit an application through their own website or through the NYC Charter School Center website (in English, Spanish and other languages):

      To apply to a high school program at a <a href="glossary.html#specialized">specialized high school</a>: There are nine specialized High Schools in New York City that are designed to serve the needs of “academically and artistically gifted students,” according to the Department of Education. Eight of these schools base admissions solely on the score attained on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT, which tests verbal and math ability). They are: the Bronx High School of Science, the Brooklyn Latin School, Brooklyn Technical High School, High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at the City College, High School of American Studies at Lehman College, Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, Staten Island Technical High School, and Stuyvesant High School. A ninth specialized High School, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, admits students based on an audition (in dance, drama, fine arts, instrumental music, technical theatre, or vocal music) and a review of academic records. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and some students prepare for the SHSAT test for years before they start 8th grade. If your child is interested in these programs s/he should be encouraged to speak with their guidance counselor in September to register for the test/audition (parochial and private school students should go to the nearest <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/NewStudents/WelcomeCenters/default.html" target="_blank">Family Welcome Center</a>). By early fall the guidance counselor will issue your child a test or audition “ticket” which indicates the location, the date, and time of the SHSAT test or audition later that fall.
