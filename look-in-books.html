      </div>
        <i>
          There is no need to go out of the way to create activities. Almost every activity you already do can be a learning opportunity for your child.
        </i>
        Here are a few suggestions and examples:
      <div class="section-copy">
        <b>
          Talk
        </b>
        <br>  
          Talking to directly to babies—even though they can’t ‘talk’ back—is fundamental to language development. Describe the world around them. Talk about what is happening and what you are doing.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Tell your baby what you are doing before you do it.</b> "I'm going to change your diaper now." Soon your baby will know what you mean and be able to respond when you say those words!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Name body parts.</b> This is easy to do during bath time or diaper change time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Converse with to your child.</b> When babies coo and babble, adults should pause (waiting until the baby is "done" in the same manner you would wait for someone to finish a sentence) and then respond with a comment or sentence of your own. This helps babies understand the pattern of a conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sing and dance.</b> Babies learn patterns of speech through music.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Make up songs with your baby's name in them. </b> For example, sing, "This is the way we change your diaper...so early in the morning."
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Recite nursery rhymes. </b> Children naturally respond to rhythm and rhymes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tell stories without a book.</b>  The good thing about made-up stories is that you can make them up as you go along. Babies usually find the voice of a caregiver calming and soothing. Older infants and toddlers will be able to recognize some of the words in your story and develop their own images in their mind!

          <li>
            <b>Go for a walk and narrate the world.  </b> Look at the world around you! Name objects in the environment. Remember that for an infant, almost everything is exciting and new.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <b>Activities</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Give babies rattles and mobiles. </b> Infants are beginning to develop eye-tracking skills. Giving them rattles or mobiles to track encourages eye movement, which will help them follow words and pictures in a book.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Name body parts.</b> This is easy to do during bath time or diaper change time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Play peek-a-boo.</b>  Action and reaction games are an important part of cognitive (thought) development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blow bubbles. </b> Blow bubbles for a baby to watch - this increases their ability to track objects. Older infants or toddlers can try to blow bubbles on their own. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Play with water.</b> Water is soothing and a great sensory experience for children. Babies need sensory experiences - these types of activities promote brain development. But never leave you child unattended around baths, sinks, buckets or other ‘pools’ of water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Play with empty boxes.</b> Empty boxes encourage creativity and thinking skills. Infants can crawl through large boxes or stack smaller ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Build with blocks.</b>  Babies learn about spatial relationships and problem solving when they play with blocks. These skills are directly related to reading and comprehension.

          <li>
            <b>Expose Baby to various textures. </b> Sensory activities (touching/feeling) are shown to have a positive impact on brain development. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fun with Food!</b>  Give babies food that challenges them to develop motor (movement) skills such as dry cereal pieces, slivers of fruit, tortillas, and other pieces of food (when properly supervised). 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dump and fill.</b>Give babies a large bin or basket for their toys. Encourage them to fill the bin and dump it. They probably won't need much encouragement since babies do this naturally! Babies will learn concepts such as in/out, up/down, clean/messy. The key is having an adult close by to help introduce and reinforce these concepts.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Put on a puppet show.</b>Puppets provide another fun and interesting way to engage in vocabulary building and language experiences!

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rotate toys. </b> When babies stop showing interest in toys, put them away and bring out something previously put away. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Play ball.</b>Playing ball and other physical activities improve motor coordination.
          <li>
            <b>Fingerpaint. </b>Exposing older infants to textures and colors increases brain activity! 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't underestimate the power of touch. </b>Touch is a necessary part of bonding with a baby. Some research shows that touch promotes brain development, physical growth, and emotional development. Cuddle with your baby.
          <li>
            <b>Smile and make eye contact! </b> It sounds simple, but sometimes we forget the importance of smiling. Research shows that babies respond to facial expressions! Babies also bond and connect with friendly faces.
