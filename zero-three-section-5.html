          Introduction: Infants and Toddlers Develop
        </div>
      
        <div class="section-copy">
          </br>
          Experts have carefully observed the behavior of babies and toddlers and have established several theories about the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development during the first years of life. Some of these theories are more complex than others, and there are significant differences among them.  Nevertheless, we can use those theories to better understand the development of babies and toddlers, and to find better ways to support them.<br/><br/>
          <strong>It is important to consider the following points:</strong><br/><br/>  
          <ul>
            <li>
              The development of babies and toddlers is the result of both factors that they bring with them from birth <strong>(biological and psychological factors)</strong> and factors that have to do with the environment in which they grow and their caretakers (social and cultural factors). <strong>Babies are born with unique personalities:</strong> there are babies who have a more active personality, or are more social, thoughtful or explorative than others. It is necessary to understand and respect the personality of every baby; at the same time, the way we raise the children will shape their character and teach them appropriate behaviors.
            </li><br/>
            <li>
              The development of every child occurs in three big areas – physical, intellectual (cognitive), which includes language use, and social-emotional. These areas are related to one another and cannot be separated. For this reason, it is said that the development of a child is “holistic” or “comprehensive”: it occurs as a group.“The development of children under three years of age includes the following areas:<br/>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gross motor skills:</strong> walking, running, climbing</li>
                <li><strong>Fine motor skills:</strong> eating by themselves, drawing</li>
                <li><strong>Sensorial:</strong> seeing, listening, tasting, touching and smelling</li>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> saying only words at first, then sentences</li>
                <li><strong>Social:</strong> playing with other people, taking turns, playing using imagination</li>  
              </ul>
              Source: <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/toddlerdevelopment.html" target="_blank">Medline Plus, “Toddler Development”</a>
            </li><br/>

            <li>
              <strong>Babies and toddlers are constantly learning, through play, observation and imitation.</strong> Small children are naturally very curious and learn to “investigate” things in their own way, with all their senses – touching, tasting, smelling, and listening to the noises things make. Likewise, babies and toddlers learn a lot by imitating the people who surround them every day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Small children shape their own personalities and strengthen their self-esteem as they start to separate from their parents and realize they are independent beings</strong> that can begin to do things by themselves. At the same time, the constant support of those who surround them gives them the stability they need to explore the world with trust and to feel sure of them selves. Therefore, they need to have close bonds with their parents or caretakers, and at the same time, enough opportunities to start doing things on their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Up until 2 or 3 years of age, children are mostly preoccupied with their own need, which is why they are “selfish”;</strong> this behavior is completely normal. As they observe and emulate those who are raising them they learn how to play with other children, how to share and understand the feelings of others. They begin to look for others’ approval by “helping” to do certain chores and sharing things. 
            </li>
          </ul><br/>
