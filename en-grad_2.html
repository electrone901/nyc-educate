        Deciding whether a Post-graduate Degree Is Right for You
      </div>
      <div class="section-copy">
        
        </br>
        Perhaps the first question a potential post-grad applicant should consider is: 
        is a post-graduate degree the best or only way to pursue my dreams?
        </br>
        </br>
        It is tempting to think about this as a purely financial decision. 
        Forbes, not surprisingly, offers an article on calculating the ROI (return on investment) 
        for a graduate degree, and they mention important considerations such as deferred earnings, 
        career prospects after graduation, and retirement possibilities: 
         
        <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2014/09/30/is-grad-school-worth-it-7-steps-to-calculating-the-roi/" target="_blank">
        See Here</a> 
        
        </br>
        </br>
        
       However, be careful not to think of ROI as merely your future earnings minus expenses. 
       Consider whether the degree helps you pursue something you are passionate about: a 
       topic, cause, a practice such as teaching or researching, or just a dream you’ve 
       always had. 
       
       </br>
       </br>
        
       With a consideration of both your dreams and the financial implications of a 
       post-graduate degree in mind, it is crucial to do research about the career or 
       degree in question. General questions include: What kind of degree do I need to 
       pursue my dreams (what area, what level of study—masters, doctoral, etc.)? What 
       is the job market like for this career / for current degree holders, and how is 
       that market projected to change?  How much do degree holders earn? How competitive 
       is the job market? Where are new jobs located? What are your career prospects 
       without this degree?
       
       </br>
       </br>
       
       More specifically you should research individual programs and schools: 
       Where are degree programs offered and how do they differ from each other 
       (there can be significant difference between programs)? How long does it take, 
       on average, to earn a degree, and what steps are involved? How are current students 
       funding their studies? What is the graduation rate? Who are the faculty (especially 
       those involved in your specific area of interest) and what are they like?
       
       </br>
       </br>
       
       You can find much of this information at public or college libraries, 
       career centers, and on the Internet. However, <strong>a key part of your research 
       should be actually taking to people.</strong> It’s particularly important to interview 
       current and past students in a program you are considering—they are among the most 
       important resources available to help you make a good initial decision and to 
       successfully complete the program should you enroll (their advice and tips 
       will be invaluable). 

       </br>
       </br>
       
       You should also interview key faculty members and/or other professionals who work 
       in your prospective field. Faculty members need to value you enough to want to work 
       with you (their individual assessment of your application and their desire to work 
       with you are among the most important factors in being accepted into a program and 
       offered funding), but you also need to consider whether you want to work with them 
       and put your career in their hands. Consider what their strengths and weaknesses are: 
       Research? Publishing? Teaching? Mentoring? Toxic faculty and especially committee 
       members can hinder even the brightest student’s career. If the school/department 
       or profession doesn’t value the fact that you need to do as much due diligence as 
       they do, you might want to consider how much you can actually achieve in that environment.
        
       </br>
       </br>
       
       Students are often encouraged to take at least a year off between undergraduate 
       and graduate studies. This time can be extremely useful for exploring new options, 
       trying different career paths, or just taking a break from a topic, even if it’s 
       one you love, to experiment with something different. This time off can also give 
       you time to do research. Just remember to stay in touch with the faculty members, 
       employers, or other people you met during college to get their letters of recommendation 
       if you do apply to grad school at a later date (an occasional card, letter, or 
       email often suffices).  
       
       </br>
       </br>
       
       Armed with research and after careful consideration, you should be able to 
       honestly answer questions about what grad school means to you:
       <ul>
       <li>
       Is the time (and deferred earnings) worth it for me?
       </li>
       <li>
       Is the extra money (or the hassle involved in securing funding) worth it for me?
       </li>
       <li>
       Am I passionate about this career?
       </li>
       <li>
       Is there some other career, topic, or experience I’ve always wanted to try?
       </li>
       <li>
       Am I considering grad school because I can’t think of anything else to do, or because my parents or teachers expect me to do it?
       </li>
       </ul>
       
       <em>There are many on-line resources available that address applying graduate school, 
       funding graduate studies, and managing you career as a graduate student.
