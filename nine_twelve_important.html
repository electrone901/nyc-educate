        What’s important: high school and life beyond (college, jobs and the future)
      </div>
      <div class="section-copy">
        If you ask most people why high school is important, they will usually answer that it prepares students for college (in the US, <a href="glossary.html#college">“college”</a> generally refers to schools offering two- or four-year degrees earned after high school, sometimes called “university” in other countries) or more generally for working and taking on the responsibilities of adulthood (Balfanz, Robert. “Can the American High School Become an Avenue of Advancement for All?” The Future of Children. Volume 19. Number 1. Spring 2009. Pp.17-36). But much more happens in high school than just college or work “prep”: students learn to socialize and interact as adults, they learn to take greater responsibility for themselves, they acquire higher analytic and math skills, they read more sophisticated and challenging books, their vocabularies grow and writing skills improve, they acquire a greater understanding of how to respect and care for their maturing bodies, they learn about diverse arts and sciences, they learn to question the world, and they continue to learn about citizenship and community involvement. For many students, it will be the last four year period in their lives that they can fully devote to learning and acquiring a formal education without the full financial and emotional demands of adulthood.
        </br>
        </br>
        Finishing high school and continuing your education is more important than ever before. According to the Pew Research Center, today’s young adults with only a high school diploma or less “are more likely to be unemployed and [spend] more time searching for a job” (Pew Research Center, February, 2014, “The Rising Cost of Not Going to College” 
        <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/02/11/the-rising-cost-of-not-going-to-college/" target="_blank">Pew Social Trends</a>). Another report estimated that “the average college graduate earns over $800,000 more than the average high school graduate by retirement age” (“Is It Still Worth Going to College?” Mary C. Daily and Leila Bengali, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Newsletter, May 5, 2014, available  
        <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2014/may/is-college-worth-it-education-tuition-wages/" target="_blank">here</a>). Receiving a high school diploma (or its equivalent) is an important step on the journey to future success. 
        </br>
        </br>
        It is important that high school students and their families learn early on (preferably during 9th grade) what requirements they will need to graduate on time and what courses and resources are offered that can best prepare them for college or the career they would like to pursue after high school. For example, NYC public high schools generally offer two types of diplomas that signify a student has completed their high school education: a 
        <a href="glossary.html#regents">Regents Diploma or an Advanced Regents Diploma</a>.  “Regents” refers to statewide, standardized tests in certain subjects that determine whether students have the minimum skills necessary to pass a subject. An Advanced Regents Diploma means that the student passed more Regents exams than required for the standard diploma, and it is considered by many to better prepare students for college. Other high schools offer various technical credentials and certifications that can help a student be career-ready.  Some high school programs also offer anning on attending college take a standardized test called the 
        <a href="glossary.html#psat">PSAT</a> in 10th grade. This test is a requirement for certain prestigious scholarship programs like the
        <a href="glossary.html#merit"> National Merit Scholarship</a>, 
        and it gives students early practice and feedback for standardized tests required for college admissions like the SAT and ACT (described below). 
        </br>
        </br>
        The best way to graduate on time and be ready for life after high school is to find out about these options and prepare for them well in advance. Parents and students should be prepared to take action and do their own research on graduation and college, and they shouldn’t necessarily wait for options to be presented to them. They should consider scheduling a ‘team’ meeting with a guidance counselor in 9th grade to find out about college and all the post-high school options available to students, about graduation requirements and timeframes, and to develop a high school education ‘game plan’ to help the student meet their objectives. They should repeat this meeting yearly or as often as necessary to be fully informed and prepared.
