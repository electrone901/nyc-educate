        How to change from my current Middle Schools / find a school better suited to my child (for 6th and 7th grade)

        <b>Applying to a new school or program:</b>
      </br>
        One option for your child is to apply to a non-zoned or “magnet” school that accepts applications from students throughout NYC. You can sometimes apply to district schools in other zones if they offer a program or services your current school lacks and if their policy permits the admission of students outside their zoned area (sometimes, students from outside the zone can be admitted if space permits, or be placed on a waiting list).
      </br>
      </br>
       The most up-to-date information on schools and programs is available at the Department of Education website, which is periodically updated.  You can search for schools by borough using the DOE search tool at 
       <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolSearch/" target="_blank">NYC.GOV School Search</a> and then go to individual school web pages for more information. You can also ask for guidance at a <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/NewStudents/WelcomeCenters/default.htm" target="_blank">Family Welcome Center</a>. You will need to contact your desired schools directly to find out their admissions policy regarding students outside their zone, if/when they have an open house or tours, and how to submit an application. 

      </br>
      </br>
        The (non-DOE) website “Inside Schools” offers a search tool that allows you to filter your search by program: 
        <a href="http://insideschools.org/index.php" target="_blank">Inside Schools</a>.
      </br>
      </br>
        Another option is to apply to a 
        <a href="glossary.html#charter">charter school</a>. These schools operate separately from the Department of Education and develop their own unique academic programs of learning, but they must meet performance goals to remain open. They have a separate admissions process and priorities (e.g., priority for children in a charter school’s community school district). Some charter schools are highly sought after, feature innovative programming, and have high testing and graduation rates. Critics say that some charter schools are of variable quality or use policies that manipulate measures of success. 
      </br>
      </br>
        The primary web source for charter school information is 
        <a href="http://www.nyccharterschools.org/charter-school-search" target="_blank">NYC Charter Schools</a>
      </br>
      </br>
      To apply to a charter school, you need to contact that school directly for information and for a paper application. Your may be able to submit an application through their own website or through the NYC Charter School Center website (in English, Spanish and other languages): 
      <a href="http://www.nyccharterschools.org/charter-school-search" target="_blank">NYC Charter Schools</a>
      </br>
      </br>
      If you are interested in changing schools, early fall is a good time to review the individual school websites, contact the school, ask about open houses or tours, and learn their admission process.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Applying for a transfer due to hardship, safety concerns, or poor school performance:</b>
      <br>
      Beyond transfer options which include re-applying to a new school or program, you can request a transfer to another public school if your child’s current assigned New York City public school presents one of the following documented hardships:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Distance from childcare or parent employment (students in K-5 only): if the distance between your child’s school and your place of employment or your childcare location creates a hardship. You must provide supporting documentation from your employer and/or childcare provider verifying the childcare hardship.
        </li>
        <li>
          To attend the same school as a sibling (students in K-5 only): for a sibling to attend school where another sibling currently attends and will continue to attend in the following school year (siblings are brothers/sisters including stepbrothers, stepsisters, foster brothers, foster sisters who live in the same household as the applicant).
        </li>
        <li>
          If your child has a severe medical issue that can be addressed by a change in school: You must provide documentation signed by a doctor on the medical provider’s letterhead stating the medical condition and the reason why the transfer is recommended. 
        </li>
        <li>
          If you feel that your child is unsafe at his or her current school: All safety transfer requests and supporting documentation must come from schools themselves. Families should not bring the documentation to the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/NewStudents/WelcomeCenters/default.htm" target="_blank">Family Welcome Centers</a>. Schools must fax an occurrence report or other school documentation; a police report, docket number or court documentation, Safety Transfer Summary of Investigation form, or a Safety Transfer Intake form, as appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your high school student’s commute is 75 minutes or greater, or otherwise inaccessible by public transportation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Through the Public School Choice (PSC) program, students who attend an eligible lower-performing school can apply for transfer to a school with “In Good Standing” status as determined by the New York State Education Department (NYSED). Priority is given to students who are identified as low-performing and low income.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A list of schools whose students may be eligible to transfer via the PSC process is available 
          <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0A635678-867A-424F-A4A1-930F9DDD8E17/0/201516PSCSENDINGSCHOOLS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of information sessions on the PSC program is available at the 
          <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/Transfers/PublicSchoolChoice/default.htm" target="_blank">DOE Public School Choice webpage</a> (or  <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/ChoicesEnrollment/spanish.html#PSC" target="_blank">click here</a> 
          for materials on the PSC program in Spanish). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Students enrolled at schools designated as “persistently dangerous” have the opportunity to request a transfer to a school that is not so designated. Schools are designated persistently dangerous if they have two successive years of serious incidents that meet or exceed criteria established by the NYSED. Eligible families will be mailed a notification letter in September.
